# FPGA_PROJECT
Design and Optimization of a 3-stage Pipelined RISC-V CPU on Xilinx PYNQ Platform, UC Berkeley      08/2023 - 12/2023
  Partnered to design a 3-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU with UART tethering.
  Integrated audio and IO components, which are done in previous FPGA lab, to create a basic audio synthesizer.
  Targeted the PYNQ-Z1 board with Zynq 7000-series FPGA.
  Digital Design: Transformed high-level specifications into a tangible hardware implementation.
  System Optimization: Boosted CPU performance, emphasizing the Iron Law, and achieved cost efficiency in FPGA resource use.
  Verilog Proficiency: Employed Verilog for RTL descriptions, interface design, and pipeline hazard resolution.
