# FPGA_PROJECT
Design and Optimization of a 3-stage Pipelined RISC-V CPU on Xilinx PYNQ Platform
1. Partnered to design a 3-stage pipelined RISC-V CPU with UART tethering.
2. Integrated audio and IO components, which are done in previous FPGA lab, to create a basic audio synthesizer.
3. Targeted the PYNQ-Z1 board with Zynq 7000-series FPGA.
4. Digital Design: Transformed high-level specifications into a tangible hardware implementation.
5. System Optimization: Boosted CPU performance, emphasizing the Iron Law, and achieved cost efficiency in FPGA resource use.
6. Verilog Proficiency: Employed Verilog for RTL descriptions, interface design, and pipeline hazard resolution.
